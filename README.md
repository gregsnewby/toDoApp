# toDoApp

Keep track of your tasks!
This handy to-do list allows you to add new tasks when you think of something new to do (click the edit button on the top right). It’ll also let you mark something complete, but not eliminate it completely. Sometimes you need to know what all you got done that day! When it does come time to delete old tasks, or getting rid of things that don’t actually need to get done, hover over the task to reveal the “delete” trash can. Simple but effective!
